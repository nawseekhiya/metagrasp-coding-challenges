/**
 * ALGORITHM fibonacciGenerator(n)
 *  n: positive integer given by user to generate first n sequence of fibonacci
 *      if n is 0, return 0
 *      if n is 1, return 1
 *      else return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
 *  generates the sequences by recursive call of function fibonacci()
 * the void main() function takes input from user as n,
 *      if the n is less than 0, it is negative, therefore invalid input
 *      otherwise, prints the fibonacci sequence by iterative call of fibonacci() from 0 to n-1
