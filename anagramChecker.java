/**
 * ALGORITHM anagramChecker(s1,s2)
 *  s1: a string taken as input from user
 *  s2: a string taken as input from user
 *       refines the string (like converting to lowercase, removing whitespaces)
 *       compares length of both strings (not equal means they cannot be anagram)
 *       sorts both the strings
 *       compares if they are equal (equal means anagram)
 * the main() takes two user inputs as two individual strings,
 * compares if anagram by calling anagramChecker() parameterized with s1,s2
 * displays the output message appropriately
