/**
 * ALGORITHM bubbleSort(a[0..n-1])
 *  a[] : array of integers taken as input from user
 *          let n be size of array
 *          the index of array runs from 0 to n-1
 *  for i <- 0 to n-1 do
 *      for j <- 0 to n-1-i do
 *          if a[j] > a[j+1]
 *              swap a[j] with a[j+1]
 * the main() takes size of array and the array itself as inputs from user
 *  calls the bubbleSort() to arrange the array in ascending order using bubble sort technique
 *  display the arranged array with appropriate output message
