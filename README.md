# Metagrasp Tech Designer Coding Challenges

This repository contains solutions for the coding challenges provided during the recruitment process for the Tech Designer Intern role at Metrograsp Technology Pvt. Ltd. Each challenge has been solved using authentic and individual approaches, following the provided guidelines.

## Languages Used

The solutions are written in **Java** and **C**. Each program is labeled according to the language used, and they can be run independently. 

## Coding Challenges

1. **Palindrome Check**  
   Write a function that takes a string as input and checks if it is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards). Ignore spaces, punctuation, and capitalization. *(Java)*

2. **Fibonacci Sequence**  
   Write a program that returns the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence, where `n` is a positive integer provided by the user. *(Java)*

3. **Factorial Calculation**  
   Create a function that computes the factorial of a given non-negative integer using recursion. *(Java)*

4. **Bubble Sort Algorithm**  
   Implement a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm. *(C)*

5. **Vowel Count**  
   Write a function that counts the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in a given string, regardless of case. *(Java)*

6. **Sum of Even Numbers**  
   Create a function that takes an array of integers and returns the sum of all even numbers in the array. *(C)*

7. **Reverse a Linked List**  
   Write a function that reverses a singly linked list. Define the structure of a node and provide the implementation. *(C)*

8. **Anagram Check**  
   Implement a function that checks if two given strings are anagrams of each other (contain the same characters in a different order). *(Java)*

9. **Find Largest Element in Array**  
   Write a function that returns the largest element in a given array of integers. *(C)*

10. **Merge Two Sorted Arrays**  
    Create a function that takes two sorted arrays and merges them into a single sorted array. *(Java)*


## Usage

To run any of the programs, clone this repository and navigate to the corresponding file. Each program is self-contained and can be compiled and executed independently in its respective language environment.

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tech-designer-coding-challenges.git
cd tech-designer-coding-challenges
```

To run Java programs:
```
javac ProgramName.java
java ProgramName
```

To run C programs:
```bash
gcc programname.c -o programname
./programname
```
